# Lightning Powered Neobanque/Wallet/Exchange

The Lightning Network (LN) is a structure of payment channels open between private individuals and/or companies, representing a significant scaling solution for Bitcoin. Often referred to as Bitcoin's Second Layer, the Lightning Network allows for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of transactions per second, enabling near-instantaneous global payments.

The Lightning Network embodies a true peer-to-peer (P2P) network, aligning with the vision outlined in Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper. While the Base (Settlement) Layer of Bitcoin operates more like a broadcast system, with transaction finality ensured by miners through the blockchain, the Lightning Network offers a decentralized and scalable alternative.

With new companies like Lightspark, founded by David Marcus (former co-creator of Diem and former president of PayPal), already onboarding major players like Coinbase, Nubank, and Xapo, we can expect many more exchanges, neobanks, and wallets to follow suit.

To facilitate this transition, you can find an up-to-date table of Neobank/wallet/Exchange that support the Lightning Network below. Let's get started!
